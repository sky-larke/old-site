		<h1> about: </h1>
		<p> 
			Hi, I'm Erin. 
			I'm an undergrad at Northwestern University working on getting a BS in Computer Science.
			My interests mainly lie in user-centered creation, such as UI/UX and game design. I've made 
			this site so it's easier to show people things I've been doing, and I'd like to start keeping
			a record of my projects.<br><br>

			I mostly do programming, some mechanical engineering, and art. 
			When it comes to languages, I have experience in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, C, C++ and Racket. 
			Engineering is pretty cool as well. I'm involved with Northwestern Formula Racing  & have done some interesting
			Northwestern-sanctioned projects, such as a chemistry-inspired educational RPG game.<br></br>
			I have 7 years of traditional art experience, mostly with drawing & painting, some of which you can see posted <a href="">here</a>.
			I mostly favored the mediums of colored pencils, oil paints, and graphite, though I did do a bit of experimentation with various other mediums.
			I've recently started working on digital art & pixel art as well, which you can see <a href="">here</a>.
