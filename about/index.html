        <h1> About</h1>
        <p> 
			I'm currently a sophomore undergrad at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Science 
            and aiming to get the Segal Design Certificate. I'm from Seattle, unless you're from Seattle,
            in which case I am actually from half an hour away from Seattle. I like making things. I'm involved with 
            Northwestern Formula Racing (in the aerodynamics subteam, despite being a CS major) and 
            do some art, mostly digitally.

            I play a good amount of games. My favorites are the singleplayer story-driven ones, but I always
            tend to play sandboxes & the rare competitive/strategic ones for social reasons. 
            Recently, I've been playing Spiritfarer, Civilization 6 and Terraria, which is a very unusual combination, but rather fun.
