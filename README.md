# portfolio site
THIS IS NOW DEFUNCT EXCEPT AS AN EXAMPLE OF ME ATTEMPTING HTML/CSS/SOME JS


I was getting tired of pulling up folders of photos on my phone, so I've made this.
This is my personal portfolio site made for the sake of organizing past, current, and future projects of mine.

Link to site [here](https://www.erinpark.org).

color palette is mine.
icons are from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
theme is based on [archie](https://github.com/athul/archie).
