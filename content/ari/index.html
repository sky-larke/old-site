				<h2> Introduction</h2>
				<p> 
					LAST UPDATED: 11/18/21<br><br>
					The concept for the game is that you play as a character who has been given a chance to redo one day . 
					It won't change the past. But you'll know whether there was something you could done differently... or not.<br><br>

		
					The typical visual novel or story-based game has paths & replayability, but you have
					to restart each time from scratch. This game is meant to have the player go through all 'paths' on each playthrough
					with a main character that knows that there are paths and choices to be made.

					Ended up doodling a concept art of a character, and suddenly it started being a thing.
